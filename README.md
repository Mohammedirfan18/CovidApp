This is a springboot web application which displays the number of confirmed covid cases from the selected states of India.

API to get all covid information of all the states : "https://data.covid19india.org/v4/min/data.min.json".
I have read the json response returned by this api and displayed confirmed covid cases of selected state.

To get confirmed covid cases of particular state use this API : "http://localhost:8080/covid-data/{statecode}" ,ex: "http://localhost:8080/covid-data/AP"
To get confirmed covid cases of particular district use this API : "http://localhost:8080/covid-data/{statecode}/{district name}" ,ex: "http://localhost:8080/covid-data/AP/Anantapur"

I have created the above two APIs using REST.
Technologies and Frameworks : HTML,CSS,javaScript,Spring,SpringBoot,RESTApi.

I am a learner please feel free to give advice to help me become a better engineer, Thank you!!!.
